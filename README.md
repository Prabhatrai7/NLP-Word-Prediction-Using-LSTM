# NLP Word Prediction Using LSTM

This project implements a **next-word prediction model** using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks — a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited to sequential text data.

The goal is to train a model that predicts the most likely next word based on a sequence of preceding words.

## 📌 Features
